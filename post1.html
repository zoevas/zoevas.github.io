            <p>
                I started as a software engineer fascinated by how systems think,
                structure knowledge, and represent meaning.
            </p>

            <p>
                Over time, I discovered semantic technologies, ontologies,
                and AI systems that go beyond simple code — they model concepts,
                relationships, and understanding.
            </p>

            <p>
                This shift changed how I design software. Instead of just
                building features, I began designing meaning-driven systems.
            </p>

            <p>
                Today, my work lives at the intersection of software,
                AI, and semantics — where logic meets creativity.
