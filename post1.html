			I designed a health ontology to assist in triaging victims during disasters. 
			This domain-specific ontology extends the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), providing a structured framework for representing medical knowledge in emergency scenarios.
			 The Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) is a small, domain-neutral top-level ontology designed to organize and integrate biomedical and other types of information. It provides a modular framework used by many biomedical ontologies, such as the Gene Ontology and Foundational Model of Anatomy.
            BFO divides all entities into two main categories: <strong>Continuants</strong>, which persist through time, and <strong>Occurrents</strong>, which unfold or happen over time. This distinction helps structure complex domain-specific knowledge consistently and systematically.

			For each victim, the ontology models key information including their medical health record, vital signs, and triage status, enabling more efficient and consistent decision-making in critical situations.
