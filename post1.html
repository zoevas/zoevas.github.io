		<p>
			I designed a health ontology to assist in triaging victims during disasters. 
			This domain-specific ontology extends the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), providing a structured framework for representing medical knowledge in emergency scenarios.
			 The Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) is a small, domain-neutral top-level ontology designed to organize and integrate biomedical and other types of information. It provides a modular framework used by many biomedical ontologies, such as the Gene Ontology and Foundational Model of Anatomy.
            BFO divides all entities into two main categories: <strong>Continuants</strong>, which persist through time, and <strong>Occurrents</strong>, which unfold or happen over time. This distinction helps structure complex domain-specific knowledge consistently and systematically.
		</p>

		<p>
			For each victim, the ontology models key information including their medical health record, vital signs, and triage status, enabling more efficient and consistent decision-making in critical situations.

<p>
In this ontology, the relationships between diseases, medications, and their corresponding effects are automatically inferred through OWL restrictions. Specifically, each disease class is linked to its physiological or clinical consequences using a diseaseHasEffect object property, while each medication class is associated with the effects it produces via medicationHasEffect. By defining OWL class restrictions—for example, specifying that a particular disease must have a certain effect or that a medication must produce a certain effect—these relationships are implicitly enforced in the ontology. As a result, any instance of a disease or medication automatically inherits the corresponding effect relationships, reducing manual annotation and ensuring consistency across the knowledge base.
</p>


<p>
As an example, in the ontology, a disease class can have restrictions linking it to specific physiological effects. For instance, the disease class <strong>Transplants (ICD10_Z94)</strong> is modeled with the following OWL restriction:
</p>

<div class="code-example" style="background-color:#f4f4f4; padding:10px; border-radius:8px; overflow:auto;">
<pre>
&lt;owl:Class rdf:about="http://www.semanticweb.org/certh/nightingale#ICD10_Z94"&gt;
    &lt;rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="http://www.semanticweb.org/certh/nightingale#Disease"/&gt;
    &lt;rdfs:subClassOf&gt;
        &lt;owl:Restriction&gt;
            &lt;owl:onProperty rdf:resource="http://www.semanticweb.org/certh/nightingale#diseaseHasEffect"/&gt;
            &lt;owl:hasValue rdf:resource="http://www.semanticweb.org/certh/nightingale#limit_response_to_hypotension"/&gt;
        &lt;/owl:Restriction&gt;
    &lt;/rdfs:subClassOf&gt;
    &lt;nightingale:icd10code&gt;ICD10_Z94&lt;/nightingale:icd10code&gt;
    &lt;nightingale:snomedCUI&gt;C0332835&lt;/nightingale:snomedCUI&gt;
    &lt;nightingale:snomedID rdf:resource="http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/SNOMEDCT/24486003"/&gt;
    &lt;rdfs:label&gt;Transplants&lt;/rdfs:label&gt;
&lt;/owl:Class&gt;
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This restriction specifies that the disease class <strong>Transplants</strong> has a physiological effect, <em>limit_response_to_hypotension</em>, through the <code>diseaseHasEffect</code> property. By including <strong>ICD-10 codes</strong> (like <code>ICD10_Z94</code>) and <strong>SNOMED IDs</strong> (like <code>C0332835</code>), the ontology supports federated queries across biomedical databases. This allows retrieving additional information from external resources, improving interoperability and enriching decision support during emergency scenarios.
